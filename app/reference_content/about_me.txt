About Me
Diverse experiences define my career but the consistent threads are hustle and curiosity. These qualities made me an early power user of Generative AI. At the outset, I had the instinct that this technology would revolutionize knowledge and creative work, to a similar extent as the Industrial Age. And I wanted in.
I jumped both feed in the barrel; (1) taking technical NLP courses, (2) expanding my software development skills spending nights and weekends on GenAI passion projects and (3) even sharing my GenAI thoughts on Medium. Today, I'm an indie hacker with an entrepreneurial spirit, who agrees with Andrew Ng that the long tail of businesses, non-tech and non-enterprise, have the most to gain from GenAI co-pilots.
When I'm not at the computer, you can find me surfing at Malibu or competing in CrossFit competitions.
