About Me
Diverse experiences define my career but the consistent threads are data and hustle. These threads made me an early and often adopter of Generative AI. As I pulled back the curtains, it became obvious this technology would change my life, change the world.
I'm an indie hacker with an entrepreneurial spirit, who agrees with Andrew Ng that the long tail of businesses, non-tech and non-enterprise, have the most to gain from Generative AI and Large Language Model co-pilots.
When I'm not at the computer, you can find me surfing at Malibu or competing in CrossFit competitions.
